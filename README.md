# XGBOOST-to-detect-Misdiagnosis-Risk-of-Chronic-Pain
This project uses a XGBOOST ML model to predict chronic pain misdiagnosis risk, a problem affecting 40-80% of patients. Analyzing pain intensity, demographics, and health history, the model currently has 72% accuracy. With a larger dataset, it aims to improve diagnostics and empower patients, helping to reduce misdiagnosis in chronic pain care.
